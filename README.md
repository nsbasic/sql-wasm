Proof of concept using sql-wasm with AppStudio

This sample is a proof of concept showing how to use sql-wasm 
in an AppStudio project.

It uses Sql-js from https://github.com/Sql-js/Sql.js/

Download latest version here:
https://github.com/Sql-js/Sql.js/releases

The code within is taken from the repo with minimal changes
so it runs as an AppStudio project.

The only output is to the console.

Feel free to reuse the code for your own purposes.
If you would like to enhance it and share your work,
please do so. We'd love to update this.

### Prerequisite

You'll need to install [AppStudio](http://www.appstudio.dev). 
You can then open and run the project.
